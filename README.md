Program: Soccer team roster (Functions, Structures, Arrays &amp; Files)  This program will store roster and rating information for a soccer team. Coaches rate players during tryouts to ensure a balanced team.  (1) Read five pairs of numbers from the file "input.txt": A player's jersey number (0 - 99) and the player's rating (1 - 9). Create a structure data type to store a single player's information (jersey &amp; rating). Then, in main( ) create an array of 11 structures to hold information for the whole team using the structure. Output the contents of the array (i.e., output the roster). Use a separate variable (playerCount) to keep track of how many players are actually stored in the array. The array may not be full at all times. (3 pts)
